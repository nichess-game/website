        <h2>Nichess </h2>
        <p>Nichess is like chess, but units have health points and abilities. Why is this a good idea? When chess was first introduced, people didn't have computers so the rules had to be such that everyone could remember them. Now, many years later, those constraints no longer apply, so it's time to improve chess.</p>
        <p>This project is in very early days. Expect many things to change.</p>
